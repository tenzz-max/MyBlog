        <p> Itachi will always be my favourite character because of the sacrifices he made for the greater good. When Itachi was interdouced he was discribed as a villain, who massacred his own clan except his younger brother. And sasuke (Itachi's younger brother) was determined to seize his vengance and kill his brother for his clan. As the show went on we learned that the Uchihas (the clan that sasuke and itachi were in) were planing on a coup d'état to overthrow the Konoha leadership. In preparation for the coup, the Uchiha started inserting its members within Konoha's command structure to act as spies. Itachi was placed in the Anbu, the direct arm of the Hokage(Konoha's learder) but the village used Itachi as thier spy and Itachi was a double agent. Itachi was smart he knew if the Uchiha's coup d'état worked it would weaken the village's defence which may cause the 4th great ninja war. So Itachi sided with the leaf and was ordered to kill his clan but he made an exception for his younger brother which he loved so much. So Itachi "prevented" the 4th great ninja war by killing his clan. He sacrificed his emotions, his loved ones and family members but he did this to protect the village and most importantly his younger brother Sasuke. That is the main reason why he will be my favourite character of all time. No character could carry as much burden and sacrifices as Itachi could. </p>
